# DrawingApp

This is an app that allows the user to draw colorful freeform lines in a blank view. It also recognizes certain gestures:

- Double tapping the screen clears all current drawings
- Swiping down with 2 fingers hides the color panel
- Swiping up with 2 fingers pulls up the color panel
- Tapping the startpoint or endpoint of a line selects the line and calls up a delete button to erase a specific line. While the line is selected, the user can drag it to a different location
- Pressing and holding on the endpoint or startpoint of a line highlights the line and the user can drag the line to a different location until releasing the press
