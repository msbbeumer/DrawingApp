# DrawingApp

This is an app that allows the user to draw colorful freeform lines in a blank view. It also recognizes certain gestures:

- Double tapping the screen clears all current drawings
- swiping up with 2 fingers pulls up a color selector menu
- tapping the screen once clears the color selector menu from the screen
- Tapping the startpoint or endpoint of ta line selects the line and calls up a delete button to erase a specific line. While the line is selected, the user can drag it to a different location
- pressing and holding on the endpoint or startpoint of a line highlights the line and the user can drag the line to a different location until releasing the press.
